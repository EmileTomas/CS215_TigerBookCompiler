## HOW TO USE

All the framework directories are `Intellij IDEA` project file, you can use `Intellij IDEA` to import project from these directories. I provide all the needed files in the framework, as for other files you may need to import from you previous project result. For example, when you import the `Parsing` Project, you may need the output file of your **Lexical** Project, which is `Yylex.java`  (You can get it via `Tiger.lex`). So it's recommended to finish these project in sequence.

If you stuck, you can refer to the `Document` directory, I provided the manual of exact how to finish these projects.

Remember to read the corresponding chapters in `Tiger Book` before you handle these projects.â€‹
